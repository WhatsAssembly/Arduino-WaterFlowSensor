# Arduino-WaterFlowSensor
Reads how much water goes through the sensor and converts to liters

# Flower.c
Just a image of a flower. Appears when water starts to flow through sensor.




# What's next:
I hope to update the GUI for this project. I would like to use a touch sensor LCD screen and would like to implement this with a web server
so it can water plants at a specific time. I still need to put more thought into what I want it to do.
